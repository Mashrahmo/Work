This C# code performs a series of experiments related to mathematical operations on arrays of numbers and measures the time it takes 
to execute each experiment using the Stopwatch class for timing. Let's go through each experiment one by one: 
Generating Random Numbers:
The code starts by generating a 2D array of random double-precision numbers using the GenRandomNumbers function. It generates n (in this case, 800,000) pairs of random numbers between 0 and 10,000.
Addition of Integers:
The AddIntegers function iterates through the generated array and adds the two random numbers in each row as integers. It stores the result in the third column of the array.
The time taken to complete this operation is measured using Stopwatch, and the elapsed time in milliseconds and ticks is displayed.
Multiplication of Integers:
Similar to the addition experiment, the MultiplyIntegers function multiplies the two random numbers in each row as integers and stores the result in the third column.
The time taken for this multiplication operation is also measured and displayed.
Direct Multiplication of Doubles (Squared):
The SquareDoublesDirectly function directly squares each double-precision number in the array by multiplying it by itself and stores the result in the third column.
Again, the time taken for this operation is measured and displayed
Using Math.Pow for Doubles (Squared):
The SquareDoublesWithMathPow function calculates the square of each double-precision number using the Math.Pow method.
Timing information is recorded and displayed.
Using Math.Sqrt for Doubles (Square Root):
The SquareRootDoublesWithMathSqrt function computes the square root of each double-precision number using the Math.Sqrt method.
Timing information is once again recorded and displayed.
he purpose of these experiments is to compare the performance of different mathematical operations on various types of numbers (integers and doubles)
and using different methods (* for multiplication, Math.Pow, and Math.Sqrt). By measuring the execution time, you can assess which approach is faster or more
efficient for the given dataset and operations.The results will provide insights into the relative performance of these operations, which can be crucial when 
dealing with large datasets or in performance-critical applications. The code is a typical example of benchmarking or profiling code to optimize performance in numerical 
computations.
